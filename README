Ruby script that slices an audio file into N-frequency bands using SoX (http://sox.sourceforge.net/)

- not sure if the high/low algorithm I selected is sound audio engineering
    - I'm using "sinc" [sinc kaiser-windowed low-pass, high-pass, band-pass]
    - The frequency progressing is 32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,etc.
    - For slice N, the window is between N-1 and N+1. So it isn't really centered on N.
    - see http://sox.sourceforge.net/sox.html for a description of the sinc algorithm
